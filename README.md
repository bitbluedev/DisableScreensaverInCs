# DisableScreensaverInCs

There can be times when you have a screensaver/screen lock after n minutes, and you don't want to, or can not disable it.
If you can however run csc and a compiled binary there is a solution.
Compile and run this code to prevent screen lock on a local machine, or remote desktop connection.
